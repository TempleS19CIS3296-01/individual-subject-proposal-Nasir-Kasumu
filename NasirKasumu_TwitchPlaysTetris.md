# Twitch Plays Tetris
# Nasir Kasumu Project Proposal

## Project Abstract
The overall project that I would like to contribute would be a standalone project called Twitch Plays tetris. The purpose of the project is to use twitch tv, a livestreaming platform for content creators and a live chat in order to create a more engaging user experience. Twitch tv livestreams games and chat to viewers on one screen essentially this software project will allow users of the livechat to affect what happens in the livestream of the game by typing in different commands

## Project Relevance
This project relates to the overall goals of our class Because it will involve a lot of multi-threading, object oriented design principles. Multithreading will be used extensively in this program because the project itself will be taking multiple commands from completely different users all at the same time. In order to run a procedure like this and optimize our performance we need to use mutlithreading. Object oriented design will be used a lot as well because we will be reusing a lot of different classes and methods for this project

## Conceptual Design
This is not an open source project so my contribution would be working on the entire project conceptually this will involve working on a way to get commands from twitch chat using the twitch api, parsing those commands with threads, translating those commands into something our emulator can understand and displaying the results of those commands as output to the game.

## Background
I have no url reference to this project because it is not an open source project but other people have made similar projects in the past and have posted them on youtube.
